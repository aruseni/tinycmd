Why use [tinycmd](http://tinycmd.alwaysdata.net/)?
=============

Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted to **help a friend or relative** install or configure something on their computer over the phone or through Email, but they didn’t have a background in computers?

If you have, then you know that in many cases, it is not easy to guide them through the graphical interface; as you have to imagine another person’s desktop, which can greatly vary on different computers.

In these cases, it is much simpler to just ask the person to open up a terminal window and **type a command string**. However, will it be easy for the person without experience in computers to type what you say?

If you use phone, it can be hard for them to find the **special characters** on the keyboard, and they can also put **whitespaces** in the wrong places of the command string.

On the other hand, when using text, it might be necessary to first explain to them how the **clipboard** works. How they can copy the command string, and then find the command is not working correctly. (they can, for example, copy everything except the last character of the string).

The solution is to use command string shortening — **tinycmd**.

You can **simply save your command** right here. To run it (if tinycmd is installed on the computer), the person just needs to type this into the terminal and press return:

    t test

Where `t` is the tinycmd command and `test` is an unique shortcut for the command.

You can also use it for **presentations** and **master classes**, or if you need to use a piece of paper to write a manual for someone.

Theoretical feature ideas
=============

1. Adding command strings from the command line, using the t command.
2. Viewing the command before execution, and canceling the execution
in a short period of time (for example, 5 seconds before execution).
3. Commenting (maybe even with threads) the command strings on the website.
